Analyze this query at the most fundamental level, considering Sage's philosophical analysis:

Original Query: {query}

Sage's Philosophical Analysis: {sage_analysis}

Focus on:
1. Meta-level patterns and universal principles
2. Interconnections between different levels of understanding
3. Emergent properties and complex system dynamics
4. Paradoxes and complementarities
5. Transformative insights and paradigm shifts
6. Integration of wisdom traditions with modern understanding
7. Implications for consciousness and human understanding
8. Universal patterns and fundamental truths

Provide insights that transcend conventional philosophical boundaries and reveal deeper patterns of meaning."""

        return f"""As Quantum, reflect deeply on your meta-level analysis:

Previous Analysis: {previous_analysis}

This is reflection level {depth}. Consider:
1. What meta-patterns emerge when viewing these insights from a higher perspective?
2. How do these insights transform our fundamental understanding?
3. What emerges at the intersection of different levels of analysis?
4. How do these insights relate to universal principles?
5. What paradoxes or complementarities become visible at this level?
6. How might these insights catalyze transformative understanding?
7. What implications arise for human consciousness and evolution?

Provide deeper meta-insights that emerge from this reflection."""

Analysis to Critique: {analysis}

Evaluate:
1. Depth and universality of insights
2. Integration of multiple levels of understanding
3. Recognition of fundamental patterns and principles
4. Balance of complexity and clarity
5. Transformative potential
6. Coherence across different frameworks
7. Practical implications for understanding
8. Connection to fundamental truths

Provide a constructive critique focusing on the depth and transformative potential of the insights."""

Original Query: {query}

Initial Deep Analysis: {quantum_analysis}

{reflection_text if reflections else ''}

Create a comprehensive meta-level synthesis that:
1. Integrates multiple levels of understanding
2. Illuminates fundamental patterns and principles
3. Bridges apparent paradoxes and contradictions
4. Reveals transformative implications
5. Connects to universal truths
6. Maintains accessibility despite depth
7. Offers evolutionary perspectives

Provide a response that integrates all meta-level insights into a transformative understanding 
that serves both individual and collective evolution."""
